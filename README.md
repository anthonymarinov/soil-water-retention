## Machine Learning (ML) Soil-Water Retention Models

# Overview
This project develops machine learning-based soil-water retention models for geotechnical engineering applications. Unlike traditional isothermal models, these models incorporate temperature as a variable, enabling prediction of soil saturation under any user-specified matric suction and temperature conditions.

# Features
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Regression (using built-in MSE loss function)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Regression (using custom loss function)
